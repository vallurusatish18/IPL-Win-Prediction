
# IPL Win Prediction

A Python / Jupyter-based project to predict the winner of IPL matches using historical match data.

<img src = "https://github.com/vallurusatish18/IPL-Win-Prediction/blob/main/UI.png">

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project uses past IPL match data (matches.csv) and machine learning / statistical methods to predict which team is likely to win a given match.  
You can run experiments in the notebook or via the `main.py` script.

## 🛠 How to Use / Run

1. **Clone this repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vallurusatish18/IPL-Win-Prediction.git
   cd IPL-Win-Prediction

2. **Install dependencies**
   Create a virtual environment and install required packages:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # (Linux / macOS)
   venv\Scripts\activate       # (Windows)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(If you don’t have a `requirements.txt`, manually install needed libraries like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, etc.)*

3. **Run in Jupyter Notebook**
   Open `IPL Win Prediction.ipynb` and follow step by step — data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation.

4. **Run via script**
   Use `main.py` for a command line prediction (if implemented).
   Example:

   ```bash
   python main.py --team1 “Mumbai Indians” --team2 “Chennai Super Kings” --venue “Wankhede Stadium”
   ```

## 🔍 What it Does

* Reads IPL match dataset (`matches.csv`)
* Preprocesses data (feature creation, cleaning)
* Builds predictive models (e.g. logistic regression, decision trees, etc.)
* Evaluates model performance
* Offers a way to input team / match conditions and get winner prediction

---

## 💡 To Improve / Extend (Ideas)

* Add more features: weather, toss decision, player stats
* Use more advanced models: Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks
* Web interface / API endpoint for predictions
* Cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning
* More data (include ball-by-ball data)
* Visualization of model performance
